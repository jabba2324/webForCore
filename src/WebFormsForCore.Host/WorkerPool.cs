// recycling limit), the worker tells the host and stops taking requests; the host starts the next worker, and requests
// wait for it while the old worker finishes the ones it has and exits. A worker that exits otherwise is replaced, up to
// rapid-fail protection's limit.

// #193: the first worker starts with the host (StartMode AlwaysRunning) or at the first request (OnDemand). A new worker
// is sent <applicationInitialization>'s pages before it takes traffic (Warming); requests wait for it meanwhile, or get
// remapManagedRequestsTo's file. An application pool recycle (Recycling(...)) is overlapped: the old worker serves until
// the new one is warm (`serving`), then recycles. A worker idle for IdleTimeout is stopped.
